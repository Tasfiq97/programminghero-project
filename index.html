                <p>You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me
                    a dime for that
                    work. That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web
                    Development Hero.</p>

                <p>I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called
                    Vue
                    JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.</p>

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
